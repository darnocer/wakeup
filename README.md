<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/next%20js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=nextdotjs&logoColor=white"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind_CSS-38B2AC?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Vercel-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel&logoColor=white"/>

This site is using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), a documentation site framework using Next.js and MDX

### Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

View on `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Content

All content is added as `.mdx` files to `/pages`. By default, it maps all `.md` or `.mdx` content in alphbetical order of the filename.

The default structure can be overridden with `_meta.json`:

Example:

```json
{
  "index": "My Homepage",
  "contact": "Contact Us",
  "about": "About Us"
}
```

### Configuration

All configuration with the Nextra theme is done in `theme.config.tsx`. Some configuration options are included here for reference. The full theme configuration documentation can be found [here](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration).

#### Banner

The banner dismissal is saved in localStorage. Update the `key` when the `text` is updated to ensure the banner is shown again for all users.

```js
  banner: {
    key: "welcome",
    text: "üçÑ Welcome to micodose.wiki!",
  },
```

#### Table of Contents

The ToC displays on the right-hand side of a page. Extra content can be displayed with `toc.extraContent`.

Here is an example of a property value being a React node (ie. extending the configuration with a custom component):

```js
import TocCallout from "./components/toccallout";
//...
const config: DocsThemeConfig = {
  //...
  toc: {
    extraContent: <TocCallout />,
  },
  //...
};
```

#### Feedback/Edit Links

These links will automatically point to the specified repository. Use these options to customize these links, or set to `null` to disable.

- Feedback: `feedback.content`
- Edit Link: `editLink.component`

#### Footer

Customize the footer with `footer.component` or update the default content using `footer.text`.

### Built-Ins

Nextra includes a few built-in components to be used in MDX which includes:

#### Callouts

```js
import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  Today is Friday.
</Callout>;
```

#### Tabs

```js
import { Tabs } from "nextra/components";

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>**pnpm**: Fast, disk space efficient package manager.</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **npm** is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>**Yarn** is a software packaging system.</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>;
```

#### Icons

```js
import { Cards, Card } from "nextra/components";
import { CardsIcon, OneIcon, WarningIcon } from "../../icons";

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<WarningIcon />}
    title="Callout"
    href="/docs/guide/built-ins/callout"
  />
  <Card icon={<CardsIcon />} title="Tabs" href="/docs/guide/built-ins/tabs" />
  <Card icon={<OneIcon />} title="Steps" href="/docs/guide/built-ins/steps" />
</Cards>;
```

#### Steps

```js
import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

<Steps>### Step 1 Contents for step 1. ### Step 2 Contents for step 2.</Steps>;
```

### Custom CSS

This project is using Tailwind. Global Tailwind configuration is done in `tailwind.config.js`. Full documentation on Tailwind can be found [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

The `@tailwind` directives were added to `globals.css` and the CSS was imported into `/pages/_app.tsx`.
