# 🍄 Microdose.wiki

# 🚧 CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## ✨ Overview

The goal of this project is to share accurate information about microdosing, specifically with psilocybin mushrooms, for someone that may be interested in trying microdosing as a means of improving their cognition or wellbeing. The information on this site is not comprehensive, but is designed to provide an overview in order to aid making an informed decision on whether or not microdosing is right for them. It is not a replacement for consulting with a medical professional.

## 💻 Development

### Built With

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/next%20js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=nextdotjs&logoColor=white"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind_CSS-38B2AC?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white"/> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Vercel-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel&logoColor=white"/>

This site is using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), a documentation site framework using Next.js and MDX

### Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

View on `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Content

All content is added as `.mdx` files to `/pages`. By default, it maps all `.md` or `.mdx` content in alphbetical order of the filename.

The default structure can be overridden with `_meta.json`:

Example:

```json
{
  "index": "My Homepage",
  "contact": "Contact Us",
  "about": "About Us"
}
```

### Configuration

All configuration with the Nextra theme is done in `theme.config.tsx`. Some configuration options are included here for reference. The full theme configuration documentation can be found [here](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration).

#### Banner

The banner dismissal is saved in localStorage. Update the `key` when the `text` is updated to ensure the banner is shown again for all users.

```js
  banner: {
    key: "welcome",
    text: "🍄 Welcome to micodose.wiki!",
  },
```

#### Table of Contents

The ToC displays on the right-hand side of a page. Extra content can be displayed with `toc.extraContent`.

Here is an example of a property value being a React node (ie. extending the configuration with a custom component):

```js
import TocCallout from "./components/toccallout";
//...
const config: DocsThemeConfig = {
  //...
  toc: {
    extraContent: <TocCallout />,
  },
  //...
};
```

#### Feedback/Edit Links

These links will automatically point to the specified repository. Use these options to customize these links, or set to `null` to disable.

- Feedback: `feedback.content`
- Edit Link: `editLink.component`

#### Footer

Customize the footer with `footer.component` or update the default content using `footer.text`.

### Built-Ins

Nextra includes a few built-in components to be used in MDX which includes:

#### Callouts

```js
import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Today is Friday.
</Callout>;
```

#### Tabs

```js
import { Tabs } from "nextra/components";

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>**pnpm**: Fast, disk space efficient package manager.</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **npm** is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>**Yarn** is a software packaging system.</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>;
```

#### Icons

```js
import { Cards, Card } from "nextra/components";
import { CardsIcon, OneIcon, WarningIcon } from "../../icons";

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<WarningIcon />}
    title="Callout"
    href="/docs/guide/built-ins/callout"
  />
  <Card icon={<CardsIcon />} title="Tabs" href="/docs/guide/built-ins/tabs" />
  <Card icon={<OneIcon />} title="Steps" href="/docs/guide/built-ins/steps" />
</Cards>;
```

#### Steps

```js
import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

<Steps>### Step 1 Contents for step 1. ### Step 2 Contents for step 2.</Steps>;
```

### Custom CSS

This project is using Tailwind. Global Tailwind configuration is done in `tailwind.config.js`. Full documentation on Tailwind can be found [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

The `@tailwind` directives were added to `globals.css` and the CSS was imported into `/pages/_app.tsx`.
